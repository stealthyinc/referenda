# Inspiration
We started building Referenda after finding a need for campaigns, movements, and other organizations to securely communicate with their members without non-stakeholders derailing conversations.

# What It Does
There are three major feature sets in Referenda: _organizing_, _fundraising_, _private social network_

**Organizing**: we help movements multiply their effort by recruiting passionate supporters and gamifying the process of spreading the word about the campaign. Referenda also enables you to import social graphs of your supporters from other traditional social media.

**Fundraising**: an important part of ensuring movements continue growing is funding. Referenda allows movements to collect donations via Apple Pay, Google Pay (powered by Square Integration) and BTC/ETH/Lightning crypto (powered by OpenNode). 

**Private Social Network**: the final piece of the puzzle for every movement is a secure way to communicate with the stakeholders something today's social media is ill suited for. With our leveling infrastructure, you can onboard users as they meet the criteria to validate their membership.

# How We Built It
We built Referenda to be scalable and future proof developmentally. 

**Codebase**: Referenda is written in React-Native with plugins for React-Native-Web. This gives us a single codebase and multi-platform deployment (web, mobile-web, iOS, and Android). Our code is located on [Github](https://github.com/stealthyinc/referenda)

**Infrastructure**: Referenda uses multiple decentralized and distributed technologies to provide the best of centralized and decentralized features that give users the maximal control of their data and privacy.
